Tests the way data item definitions from different dictionaries are merged
into a single definition.

Data item '_list_link_child' values from the '_ddl1_merge_base_loop_id_update'
definition data block ('ddl1_merge_base.dic' dictionary) should be added
to the already defined values in the '_ddl1_merge_base_loop_id' definition
data block ('ddl1_merge_base.dic' dictionary).
