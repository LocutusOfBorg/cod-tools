_definition
;
 A category with a slightly incorrect human-readable definition. The definition
 contains references to non-existing data item names
 ( _test_item_with_no_existence ), as well as unrecognised categories
 like the TEST_CATEGORY_WITH_NO_EXISTENCE category.

 However, the definition also contains proper references like the one to the
 _test_unrecognised_names_in_descriptions_item data item or the
 TEST_UNRECOGNISED_NAMES_IN_DESCRIPTIONS (_test_unrecognised_names_in_descriptions_[])
 category.

 Some data names refer to items and categories in other dictionaries and as
 such are only considered correct when the appropriate dictionary is supplied.
 Consider the TEST_EXTERNAL_CATEGORY category and the
 _test_external_category_item item as an example.

_type                        char
_definition
;
 Unrecognised references include the on to the _test_missing_item data item
 as well as the TEST_MISSING_ITEM category.

 Proper references include the ones to the _test_unrecognised_names_in_descriptions_item
 data item or the TEST_UNRECOGNISED_NAMES_IN_DESCRIPTIONS
 (_test_unrecognised_names_in_descriptions_[]) category.

 Some data names refer to items and categories in other dictionaries and as
 such are only considered correct when the appropriate dictionary is supplied.
 Consider the TEST_EXTERNAL_CATEGORY category and the
 _test_external_category_item item as an example. 

 The newline symbol should also should be properly treated as a word separator
 and not as part of the potential data name, i.e. _test_unrecognised_names_in_descriptions_item
should not be properly recognised.
