<abstract>In this work, we describe the design, synthesis, characterization, photophysical evaluation, DFT calculations, and application of two novel fluorescent benzothiadiazole (BTD) sensors for hydrazine detection and quantification at the cellular and multicellular (<i>in vivo</i>) levels. The two probes were fully characterized, and their photophysical properties were evaluated. We tested the designed fluorogenic dye (named BTD-CHO) as a selective sensor for the rapid, sensitive, and selective detection of hydrazine. When treated with N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, the probe affords a new derivative named BTD-HZN, releasing water as the only byproduct. BTD-CHO exhibited a preference for lipid droplets (LDs) and accumulated inside these organelles. Hydrazine detection in LDs could be carried out by the <i>in situ</i> formation of BTD-HZN inside live cells. We efficiently visualized the lipids of a challenging cellular model, microalgae (<i>Chlorella sorokiniana</i>), using these sensors. <i>In vivo</i> experiments indicated rapid and efficient detection of the analyte using <i>C. elegans</i> and zebrafish (Danio rerio) as the multicellular models.</abstract>
