             Proposal to add data items that specify the
        sample acquisition location to the CIF Core dictionary
      ==========================================================

Abstract
--------

1. Existing means of specifying the sample location
----------------------------------
   The current version of the CIF Core dictionary provides the
   _chemical_compound_source [1] data item for the purpose of recording
   the source of the compound under study.

   [1] _chemical_compound_source description from cif_core.dic v2.4.5:
   Description of the source of the compound under study, or of the
   parent molecule if a simple derivative is studied. This includes
   the place of  discovery for minerals or the actual source of a
   natural product.

2. Drawbacks of the current means
---------------------------------
   1. Structurelessness: the _chemical_compound_source data item is
      not sufficient to convey the physical location at which the
      examined sample was obtained in a structured manner;
   2. Broadness: the same _chemical_compound_source can be used to
      store different kind of information (names of parent molecules,
      plants that the molecule was extracted from, name of the
      locality that the mine is located in, etc).

3. Proposed extension
---------------------------------
   1. A new category dedicated for storing the information about the sample
      acquisition location should be created;
   2. The category should have data items that record at least the following
      positional information:
      1) locality (human-readable common name of location);
      2) latitude;
      3) longitude;
      4) elevation above the sea level;
      5) the depth at which the sample was acquired taking the elevation as
         the starting reference point.

4. Proposed implementation
