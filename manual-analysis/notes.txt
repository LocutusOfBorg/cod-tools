cif_molecule generation of stoichiometric or P1 cells with the
treatment of the disorder around the special position.

-- 1544968 (S.G.) â€“ covalent radius for Hydrogens too small to detect
   group self-bumps; works correctly with --bump-distance-factor 1.6
   option. The default Jmol and cif_molecule behaviour (not to apply
   symmetry operators to the disordered hydrogen atoms) is wrong.
