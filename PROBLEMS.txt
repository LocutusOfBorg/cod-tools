Problems still detected in special position disorder processing
===============================================================

1. [FIXED] When an operator set that does *not* contain unity is applied
   to a group that is disordered around a special position, the atoms
   of this group are not included into the initial atom list of
   'cif_molecule'. This leads to some non-polimeric molecules missing
   in the output if --special-disorder-operator-set other than 0 is
   selected. The bug manifests itself when processing 7227613:

	./scripts/cif_molecule --special-disorder-operator-set=1 $(codid2file 7227613)

   The BF4 moiety is missing in the output.

   This bug does not affect polymers such as COD 4111132 where the
   disordered group is included into the polymer; apparently the atoms
   are found via the covalent bond link.

2. When polymer parts are connected via loops that go outside the
   specified supercell (--max-polymer-span limits), the polymer
   trimmer removes those loops and the polymer representations become
   disconnected (this problem is seen in 7227613).

3. In the COD 7042409 structure, some benzene rings, including those
   that contain atoms disordered around a special position, com out
   distorted. It seems that disorder groups, including the "regular"
   disorder groups (i.e. those that are *not* disordered around a
   special position) are described incorrectly in the deposited COD
   file.
