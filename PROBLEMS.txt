Problems still detected in special position disorder processing
===============================================================

1. [BUG] When an operator set that does *not* contain unity is applied
   to a group that is disordered around a special position, the atoms
   of this group are not included into the initial atom list of
   'cif_molecule'. This leads to some non-polimeric molecules missing
   in the output if --special-disorder-operator-set other than 0 is
   selected. The bug manifests itself when processing 7227613:

	./scripts/cif_molecule --special-disorder-operator-set=1 $(codid2file 7227613)

   The BF4 moyety is missing in the output.

   This bug does not affect polymers such as COD 4111132 where the
   disordered group is included into the polymer; apparently the atoms
   are found via the covalent bond link.
